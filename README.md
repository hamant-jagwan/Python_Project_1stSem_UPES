## Installing the dependency

1. using vscode to run my ananlysis
2. Install all the dependences ex: required library(Pandas , numpy , matplotlib and seaborn)
3. I am uploading my virtual environment here name as `myEnv` through this command `python -m venv myEnv` and activate it using `myEnv\Scripts>activate`
4. install all the dependencies using `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`

Now, keep you belt tight to deep down in this data analysis.

data Loading : I am loading data directly from github using this link `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamant-jagwan/Python_Project_1stSem_UPES/refs/heads/main/Red_Wine_Quality.csv`
and use pandas to read this csv file

## Overview


# Red Wine Quality Analysis

This project involves analyzing the red wine quality dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The analysis includes data exploration, cleaning, and visualization to understand the relationships between different chemical properties and wine quality.

## Steps

### 1. Import Necessary Libraries
We start by importing the required Python libraries for data manipulation and visualization: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

### 2. Load the Dataset
The dataset is loaded from an online source and read into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

### 3. Data Exploration
We examine the dataset to understand its structure and content, including the number of entries, data types of columns, and presence of any missing values.

### 4. Check and Remove Duplicate Values
We identify and remove duplicate entries to ensure data quality. This step involves checking for duplicated rows and dropping them from the DataFrame.

### 5. Descriptive Analysis
We compute descriptive statistics for all columns, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. Additionally, we include the mode for each column to get a better understanding of the data distribution.

### 6. Visualization
We create several plots to visualize the data and understand the relationships between different variables:

#### Wine Quality Classes Frequency
A count plot showing the frequency distribution of wine quality classes, helping us to see how wine quality is categorized in the dataset.

#### Volatile Acidity vs Quality
A bar plot illustrating the relationship between volatile acidity and wine quality, which helps in understanding how volatile acidity impacts the quality of wine.

#### Citric Acid vs Quality
A bar plot showing the relationship between citric acid and wine quality, providing insights into how citric acid levels correlate with wine quality.

#### Correlation Heatmap
A heatmap displaying the correlations between different chemical properties of wine, helping us to identify which properties are most strongly associated with each other and with wine quality.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into the relationships between various chemical properties of red wine and their quality. The visualizations help in understanding these relationships clearly, and further analysis can be performed to build predictive models for wine quality.
